      In 2023, our rookie year, we created Namazu. Named after a giant catfish
      responsible for earthquakes in Japanese mythology, Namazu shook up the
      competition with its quaking capabilities. This season we made it all the
      way to districts but ended up short on points to move on to worlds.
